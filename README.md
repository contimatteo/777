# **777 Game**
Development of a multi-level expanding map game, implemented through 2d graphics.

### Rules
Game based on a system of generation of random maps that follow one another like in a real building: there is a single tower in which there are several rooms divided by floors.
The number of enemies is determined by the room and the floor to which we are.
The enemies change their position randomly and their attack grows proportionally with the visit of the tower.
The aim of the game is to find Tony Effe.

## Getting Started
No internet connection needed, but only a keyboard and some game skills ü§ì

### Prerequisites
For the building the source we need a C++ compiler.
If you don‚Äôt own a Mac, set you free to choose whatever you prefer but we strongly recommend you to use [GCC Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org) ‚úåüèº

### Linux
Run this command in terminal:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

### OSX
Run this command in terminal:
